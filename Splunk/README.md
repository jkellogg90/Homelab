# Splunk 
Here are some use cases I created in my Splunk homelab instance modeled from MITRE ATT&CK. This isn't meant to be comprehensive. This is just what I created in my free time with a small data set. Use cases were created by using the technique in a Windows 10 virtual machine with Sysmon installed and they creating the Splunk query in the console. 

If you plan on using these in production, I'd tune them to fit your environment. I'm working with a limited data set so you will get different results in a production environment. 

I'm focusing on the most commonly used tactics of MITRE.
