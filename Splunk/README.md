# Splunk 
Here are some use cases I created in my Splunk homelab instance modeled from MITRE ATT&CK. This isn't meant to be comprehensive. This is just what I created in my free time.

If you plan on using these in production, I'd tune them to fit your environment. What works well in my small homelab might not work well in a large enteprise. :)
